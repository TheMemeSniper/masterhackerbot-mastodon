# masterhackerbot

This is a re-creation of a Reddit bot that will reply to a comment (when mentioned) with random tech-related jargon

An OpenAI GPT-3 key is required to use this program so it can interpret the title of the post. Make sure you have a key saved to environment variable "OPENAI_API_KEY"

Run masterhackerbot.py to test the output, which will allow the user to type in text and generate a phrase from the text

Running post.py will log in to Reddit, scan the user's mentions, and reply with the generated text.
